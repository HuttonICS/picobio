This is the README file for the picobio repository,
https://github.com/peterjc/picobio

This is a small general hold all for Miscellaneous Bioinformatics scripts etc
mostly in Python, written by Peter Cock.

The name "picobio" is a play on "pico" meaning small (10^-12), and the
Japanense phonetics of my name (ピーター starting "pi" in the Latin alphabet,
and コック starting "ko", giving "piko"), "bio" from Bioinformatics.

Unless otherwise stated, the scripts in this repository are released under the
MIT License.
