usage = """Python script to remove SAM reads with long CIGAR strings.

The BAM format (currently) uses an unsigned 16bit integer for the
number of CIGAR operations in a read, and therefore BAM files can
only hold reads with up to 65535 CIGAR operators. SAM does not have
this limit, but the samtools implementation (reasonably) also has
the same 16bit limit. See also:
https://github.com/samtools/samtools/pull/39

This script is designed to be used as part of a Unix pipeline. It
takes no command line arguments. It reads SAM format data from stdin,
and writes SAM format data to stdout.

The only change made to the SAM reads is to drop records with over
65535 CIGAR operators. These are logged to stderr.

$ ./sam_drop_long_cigar.py < original.sam > no_long_cigar.sam

Simple usage with BAM files with conversion to/from SAM via samtools:

$ samtools view -h original.bam | ./sam_drop_long_cigar.py | samtools view -S -b - > no_long_cigar.bam
